* Data type recognition is too weak

* Generalize data type conversion

* Oh,oh! where did we handle Remainder Bits?

* Implement JIS X 0201 character set encoding [pseudo-done]
  
  It should be quite easy as the mapping is 8 bit per character and we have a
  nice reference table

* Implement masking patterns and choice based on ranking
  
  Only mask pattern '000' is implemented and applied. We should build all
  other patterns and the ranking algorithm in ISO/IEC 18004 Table 24

* Refactoring and tests

  * bch calculation for version information instead of reference table use

* Documentation
